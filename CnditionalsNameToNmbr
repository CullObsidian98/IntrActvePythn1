# Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock template


# The key idea of this program is to equate the strings
# "rock", "paper", "scissors", "lizard", "Spock" to numbers
# as follows:
#
# 0 - rock
# 1 - Spock
# 2 - paper
# 3 - lizard
# 4 - scissors

# helper functions

    # delete the following pass statement and fill in your code below
    def name_to_number(name):
    if name == "rock":
        return 0
    elif name == "Spock":
        return 1
    elif name == "paper":
        return 2
    elif name == "lizard":
        return 3
    elif name == "scissors":
        return 4
    else:
        return "Error Invalid Entry"

    # convert name to number using if/elif/else
    # don't forget to return the result!
